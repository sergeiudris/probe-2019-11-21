* private repository for persoanl use
* solutinos for myself
    - for multiple years now i'm trying to find a dataset to build around
    - many of previous repos were attempts to achive this - probe, shipstudio, sci-lab, ask-data, askwiki, 
    probe-system, moverecom, funworld, mnist etc.
    - it is all in the direction of 'datum system' 
    - so probe is a precursor-type solution to explore datasets 
    
* design
    - should run on local machine
    - should allow for repl and simple visualizion, sampling
    - searching and quering
    - forming other datasets, machine learning
