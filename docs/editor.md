* browser editor:
   - lack intall plugins (because fetch every time)
   - lack file system access
   - cannot backup your .data in a git repo 
   - no access to launching processes

* electron editor:
    - cannot run from docker container

* docker + locahost editor:
    - problematic file system access
    + can save plugins and history
    + can run taks outside browser (say, loading a file)s
    - cross origin
    - still in browser


* windows vs tabs
    - tabs are btter:tabs bring structure, windows stimulate chaos
    - splitting screen in rectangles is enogh to drga between tabs

* what kind of ui matters:
    - plugin based, editor like, systemic
    - web apps serve a purpose but time+effort/outcome ration is subpar
